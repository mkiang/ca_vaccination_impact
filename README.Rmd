This is reproducible code for our forthcoming paper, ["Recent Shifts in Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Mortality in the Vaccination Period in California"](TODO), which uses **restricted-access**, decedent-level death certificate data from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to systematically examine racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 deaths during the vaccination period.

## Issues
Please submit issues [via Github](https://github.com/mkiang/ca_vaccination_impact/issues) or via email.

## Important note about reproducibility 

In accordance with our data use agreement with the CDPH Vital Statistics, we cannot share individual level data. When possible, we provide aggregated data in cases where there are more than 10 observations. This restriction means this pipeline is not fully reproducible without the restricted-access data. 

## Software

All analyses are conducted using `R`, which can be [downloaded via CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), and the Joinpoint Regression Program, which can be [downloaded from the National Cancer Institute](https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/). 

We also recommend the use of  [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) when running `R`, which will allow users to take advantage of [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for dependency management.

# Analysis pipeline
The analysis pipeline is divided into three discrete steps. 

In Step (1), we clean, subset, munge, and calculate mortality rates using the raw (restricted-access) data. This results in a working dataframe that contains the data necessary for the Joinpoint Regression Program to fit our models of interest. These are held in the `01` to `04` code files. 

In Step (2), the joinpoint regressions are fit in an external program ([NCI Joinpoint Regression Program](https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/)) and the results are exported. The `./joinpoint_analyses/age_std_rates.jps` file contains our session information to reproduce our analysis and requires the `./joinpoint_analyses/age_std_rates_long.csv` file generated from the step above (potentially with noise added to small cells). 

In Step (3), the resulting (exported) joinpoint files are combined into a single file for plotting and to create tables. These are code files `05` to `08`.

All files should be run sequentially.
